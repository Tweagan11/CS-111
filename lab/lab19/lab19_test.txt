<p>Pair programming is a way to program collaboratively with a partner.
Itâs a great approach when youâre learning how to program, plus itâs
used by many companies in the tech industry.</p>
<p>In pair programming, partners are working together <em>at the same time</em>.
One partner is the âdriver,â who actually types the code. The other
partner is the ânavigator,â who observes, asks questions, suggests
solutions, and thinks about slightly longer-term strategies.</p>
<p>Itâs very important for partners to switch roles throughout an
assignment, either every 10-20 minutes or alternating each problem.</p>
<p>This is the traditional approach to pair programming. Partners sit
together at the same computer, ideally one with a large or double
monitor. The driver controls the keyboard and mouse, while the navigator
looks at the code and assignment description.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it is also very possible to do pair programming online,
thanks to the wide range of collaborative cloud applications.</p>
<p>Youâll need two things:</p>
<p>For hearing each other, you can set up a Zoom call, Google Meet, or
Discord call.</p>
<p>For sharing code, you can follow the instructions for your editor of
choice:</p>
<p>Youâll generally want to both be using the same editor, so youâll either
want to find a partner using the same editor or be willing to try a new
editor. That can be a part of the learning experience, too!</p>
<p>There are also online editors that support collaboration. One option is
Repl.it, as long as you use private repls (learn how to get a <a href="https://replit.com">free
account</a>). You will still need to run the Ok
commands on your computer.</p>
<p>If for some reason youâre unable to do actual pairing in an editor, you
can always fall back to a shared Google Doc. Just make sure to turn off
the auto-correct in your document, or your code will get infused with
new and exciting syntax errors.</p>
<p>We encourage pair programming in projects. Youâre also permitted to pair
program on a lab problem, especially if you are stuck. Just make sure
that you are always alternating between roles so that you are both
learning from the experience. You should <strong>not</strong> be pair programming on
homework assignments, however, since you are required to write your own
code for them.</p>
<p>See the <a href="/articles/about/#learning-cooperatively">course policies</a>
for more information.</p>
<p>We recommend finding a partner in your recitation section.</p>
<p>Youâre not required to have the same partner for every project. Pair
programming is as much about communication styles as it is about coding
styles, so itâs important to find a partner that you are able to
communicate well with.</p>
<p>For non-project assignments, you should submit your work
<strong>individually</strong>.</p>
<p>If youâre working on a <strong>project</strong> together with a partner, <strong>only ONE</strong>
of you should needs to submit the assignment to Ok. Once the assignment
has been submitted, you must then add your partner by inviting them by
email. Make sure to accept the invitation or the partnership wonât be
official. See <a href="/articles/using-ok/">Using Ok</a> for more
information.</p>
<p>We expect partners to communicate with each other, arrange times to meet
for pairing, and participate equally in the process of pair programming.
If one of you would like to work separately on particular parts of a
project, you should communicate that with your partner.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: If you agree verbally (or via email) to work with a given
partner on a given assignment, you are expected to work through that
assignment with that partner to completion. You canât abandon your
partner in the middle of an assignment unless the decision to unpair is
mutual for both of you. Please be considerate for your partner and donât
leave them hanging without an easy way to find a new partner in
mid-assignment. If you are planning to end your partnership and do the
next assignment alone, please tell your partner this as soon as possible
when the assignment is given out, so that they can make other
arrangements.</p>
<p>We sometimes see feedback like:</p>
<p>My partner didn't do any work, or didnât do their share of the work,
or didnât communicate or meet with me, etc. What can I do?</p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>My partner did too much! They hogged the keyboard, or they did the
whole assignment without waiting for me, or they didnât communicate
with me, etc. I feel that I didnât get a real chance to help in
solving the assignment. What can I do?</p>
<p>Have you tried speaking to your partner about your expectations
beforehand? Many group issues can be resolved by better communication
and setting expectations.</p>
<p>If talking to your partner does not resolve the situation, speak to
course staff and explain the details of what has happened. We will try
to help you resolve the issue. If it is an ongoing problem, staff can
help you find you a partner or allow you to dissolve your partnership
and submit individually.</p>
<p>You can go ask for help from the course staff in office hours. We ask
that <strong>only one of you</strong> enqueue for help at a time. That is, please
donât try to âdouble upâ by enqueuing both of your names in the line. If
we find that a pair is doing this, we will remove both of their names
and move one of them to the very back of the queue. Thank you for your
cooperation.</p>
